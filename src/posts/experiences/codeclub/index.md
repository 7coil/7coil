  As part of my enthusiasm for computer programming and technologies,
  I worked in my local library to teach children the fundamentals of
  computer programming, introducing them to programming languages such as
  Scratch, HTML and CSS and Python, as well as other cool modern gadgets
  and technology, such as 3D modelling and printing.
