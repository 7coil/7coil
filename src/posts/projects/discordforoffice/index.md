To ensure untrusted applications from being executed on your computer,
Microsoft do not allow the installation of applications not signed for,
or not in your "Trusted Internet Sites" list.

To add our link to your list:

- Open Internet Options in the Start Menu
- Enter the Security tab
- Click on Trusted Sites
- Click on Sites
- Add `https://office.terminal.ink` to the list of trusted sites

### Step 2: Download and install DiscordForOffice

## Issues

### 2016/2019 Differentiation

The version number of Microsoft Office 2016 and 2019 are shared, and not different like past versions of Office.
There is currently no differentiation in the software as a result.
